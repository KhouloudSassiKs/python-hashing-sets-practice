# python-Lists-dictionaries-sets-practice
This repository contains practice code for Python data structures such as hashing, sets, and dictionaries.  
Includes simple examples and exercises to reinforce concepts.
The code in this repository contains my personal practice solutions from CodeSignal.
All code is written independently as part of my ongoing learning and skill development.
